## Pull Request Process

1. It is advised to create a Pull Request if you are stuck (so others can help
   you) or when your feature is complete and tested.
2. To be merged, your Pull Request must have a passing build on the [Continuous
   Integration server][semaphore].
3. To be merged, your Pull Request should add relevant tests (when applicable).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other
   developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   reviewer to merge it for you. If you do have merging permissions on the
   repository, you must rebase and squash your Pull Request into a single
   commit.
